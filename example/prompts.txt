In a lush, sunlit meadow, a fluffy white sheep with a gentle expression grazes beside a large, brown-and-white cow. The cow, with its soulful eyes and sturdy frame, stands calmly, chewing on the vibrant green grass. The scene is framed by rolling hills and a clear blue sky, with a gentle breeze rustling the wildflowers scattered across the field. The sheep occasionally looks up, its woolly coat shimmering in the sunlight, while the cow's tail swishes lazily, creating a serene and harmonious pastoral setting.
